Here are some ambient background loops to help the game feel less dry!

If you implement these sounds and they feel too loud or distracting feel free to 
lower their volume. 

I have also included some individual audio layers that make up these ambient loops.
It could be a cool effect to crossfade between different layers to make the 
ambience evolve subtly over time
